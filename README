# html-css-code-refactor-module-1

## Description

- This was the first project at my Bootcamp course. 
- The html file didn't have semantic structure, the code had to be cleaned up. Images needed an alt description.
- I made many mistakes and I started from the beginning at least 15 times. Mostly what I learned was do one step at a time (html + css)
